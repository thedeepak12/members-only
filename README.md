# Members Only

Members Only is a private, invite‑only group chat where posts are public but identities are hidden. Non‑members can read and post, but they see every sender as "Anonymous". Join with a membership code to reveal who said what and take part in the conversation.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Local username/password auth with sessions.
- **Messages Feed**: Browse and post messages.
- **Members-Only Features**: Non-members see all senders as "Anonymous", members see actual names.
- **Membership Gate**: Join the club by entering a membership code to unlock full visibility.
